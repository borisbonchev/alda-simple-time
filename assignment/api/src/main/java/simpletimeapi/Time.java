/**
 * The unit of points in Time (instant; like java.time.Instant) and duration (as
 * used in this appointment planner application).
 *
 * All Time instances are ALWAYS normalized. Normalizing results in: <ul>
 * <li>The range for the hours field is {@code [0, 24)} </li>
 * <li>The range for the minutes field is {@code [0, 60)} </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Hints to implementer:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Assuming that you have a constructor or a factory method that takes an
 * hours and a minutes parameter, compute the total number of minutes. If this
 * total is less than 0 or greater equal than 24 * 60, an
 * IllegalArgumentException with an appropriate message should be thrown.
 * Otherwise, compute the number of hours and minutes from this total. This
 * implies that negative minutes as parameter value might be allowed.</li>
 * <li>It might be useful to have a method {@code int asMinutes()} that returns
 * the number of minutes since midnight.</li>
 * <li>Override the methods toString(), equals() and hashCode(). toString
 * returns Time in hh:mm format. </li>
 * </ul>
